# 🚀 Advanced Locomotion System (ALS) + Unreal Engine Motion Matching Integration  

---

## 🌟 **Features**  

✅ **Base Features from ALS and Motion Matching Sample**  
✅ **Overlay Layering System** built with separate **Anim Graphs** and **Linked Layers**  
✅ All the original **ALS Overlays** (Masculine, Feminine, Injured, etc.)  
✅ **Weapon Attach System** for dynamic equipment interaction  
✅ **Overlay Switcher Widget** for easy overlay testing and transitions

## 🛠️ **What’s Included?**  

This base project includes the following core functionality:  

🎨 A robust **Overlay Layering System** to dynamically alter locomotion animations.  
🎮 Unreal Engine's **Motion Matching Sample** for advanced, fluid animations.  
🧰 Custom events for controlling the replication of the overlay state.

## 🧩 **How It Works**  

This project builds on the GASP foundation with:  

1. **Overlay Animations**: Modify locomotion with ALS overlays like **Masculine**, **Feminine**, or **Injured** states.  
2. **Anim Graph Integration**: Separate Anim Graphs and Linked Layers for modularity.  
3. **Weapon Attachment System**: Attach and switch weapons seamlessly.

## 📦 **Getting Started**  

1. Clone or download this project.  
2. Open it in **Unreal Engine 5.5+**.  
3. Explore and customize the `Blueprints` and `Animation` folders.  
4. Use the **Set Overlay State** in the Sandbox Character BP(Red Comment).
